# SystemShogun

Welcome to **SystemShogun**! This repository is a collection of examples and resources to complement the blog posts that I write on my blog [SystemShogun.com](https://systemshogun.com/). Here, youâ€™ll find practical, real-world implementations of concepts I cover in there, mainly related to [.NET](https://dot.net/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.com/).

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Provide **working examples** that you can clone, run, and customize.
- Demonstrate **best practices** for cloud development, automation, and secure deployments.
- Serve as a companion to my blog posts, where I dive deeper into the "why" and "how."

## Who Is This For?

This repository is for:
- **Developers** looking for practical examples of cloud development.
- **Architects** interested in designing scalable and secure infrastructure.
- **DevOps Engineers** who want to automate cloud deployments.
- **Learners** eager to understand modern tools like Terraform, GitHub Actions, and Azure.

## Blog content

#### Deploy from GitHub Actions to Function App behind private endpoints (or completely disabled for public access)
